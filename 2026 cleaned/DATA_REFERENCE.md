## 📍 WEATHER DATA (`weather.json`)

Environmental conditions recorded approximately once per minute during the session.

| Abbreviation | Full Name | Description | Unit |
|---|---|---|---|
| **wT** | Time | Session time when this weather sample was recorded from the start of session | seconds |
| **wAT** | Air Temperature | Ambient air temperature around the track | °C (Celsius) |
| **wH** | Humidity | Relative humidity of the air | % (percentage) |
| **wP** | Pressure | Atmospheric air pressure | mbar (millibars) |
| **wR** | Rainfall | Boolean flag indicating whether it was raining at this moment | Boolean (True/False) |
| **wTT** | Track Temperature | Temperature of the asphalt surface | °C (Celsius) |

| **wWS** | Wind Speed | How fast the wind is blowing | m/s (meters per second) |

### Why Weather Matters in F1
Weather affects lap times dramatically. Cold air reduces engine power, hot tracks reduce tire grip, rain changes braking distances. Wind direction affects DRS (Drag Reduction System) effectiveness and how the car handles in turns.

## 📋 RACE CONTROL MESSAGES (`rcm.json`)

Messages sent by Race Control (the officials) to teams about track status, penalties, and incidents.

| Abbreviation | Full Name | Description | Values |

| **cat** | Category | Type of message being sent | "Other", "Flag", "Drs", "CarEvent" |
| **msg** | Message | Human-readable description of the event | Examples: "Yellow Flag", "DRS Enabled", "Unsafe Release" |
| **status** | Status | Additional context about the message state | Examples: "DISABLED", "ENABLED", depends on category |
| **flag** | Flag | Type of flag being waved (if applicable) | "GREEN", "RED", "YELLOW", "CLEAR", "CHEQUERED" |
| **scope** | Scope | How wide the impact of this message is | "Track" (entire track), "Sector" (one of 3 sectors), "Driver" (specific driver) |
| **sector** | Sector | Which mini sector is affected (if scope is "Sector") There are 3 sectors, each divided into 8 mini sectors | 1-24 |
| **dNum** | Driver Number / Racing Number | The driver's car number affected by the message (if scope is "Driver") | String: "1", "44", "63", etc. |
| **lap** | Lap | Which lap number this message refers to | Integer: lap number |

### What This Means
When a yellow flag is deployed due to debris in Sector 2, you might see: `{cat: "Flag", msg: "Yellow", flag: "YELLOW", scope: "Sector", sector: 2}`. This tells teams drivers must slow down in that sector.

### Acceleration Vectors (G-Forces)
The car experiences forces in three directions simultaneously. These are **computed by the extraction script** using gradient analysis of position, speed, and distance data. **These are NOT raw IMU sensor values**—they are mathematically derived and heavily processed.

| Abbreviation | Full Name | Axis Direction | Computation Formula | Outlier Handling | Smoothing |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `acc_x` | Longitudinal Acceleration | Forward/backward (along track) | `ax = gradient(v_ms) / gradient(time)` where `v_ms = speed / 3.6` | If `ax > 25 m/s²` (one-sided, positive only), value is replaced with previous sample's value. Boundary samples (first/last) are excluded. | 3-point moving average |
| `acc_y` | Lateral Acceleration | Side-to-side (horizontal) | `ay = v² × C` where `C = dθ / (ds + 0.0001)`, `θ = arctan2(dy, dx)`, phase-unwrapped | **Stage 1 (intermediate):** if `\|dθ\| > 0.5 rad/sample`, replace with previous value before computing C and ay. **Stage 2:** hard-zero if `\|ay\| > 150 m/s²` (~15G) | 9-point moving average |
| `acc_z` | Vertical Acceleration | Up/down (elevation changes) | `az = v² × C_z` where `C_z = dθ_z / (ds + 0.0001)`, `θ_z = arctan2(dz, dx)`, phase-unwrapped | **Stage 1 (intermediate):** if `\|dθ_z\| > 0.5 rad/sample`, replace with previous value. **Stage 2:** hard-zero if `\|az\| > 150 m/s²` (~15G) | 9-point moving average |

**Note**: Position data is interpolated (estimated between actual measurements) to align with the higher-frequency car data. The car data comes at ~240ms intervals, position data at ~220ms, so they need to be matched up.

### Other Telemetry Fields
| Abbreviation | Full Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **dataKey** | Data Key | Unique identifier that links this telemetry data to a specific driver and lap |

This is of the format - "Year-EventName-Session-Driver 3 letter code-Lap Number"
eg. "2025-United States Grand Prix-Race-VER-9"

For 2026 Pre-Season Testing, we are using 'PreSeasonTesting1' as EventName instead of 'Pre-Season Testing 1'
